# TIMETABLING-SCHEDULING-SYSTEM
The timetable of an institution is one of its most essential features. That is why all institutions, large and small, adhere to a schedule. It is a schedule that divides the school day into different times and assigns different subjects to each session. A time chart lists the activities that must be completed in a school on a specific day. As a result, it is critical in institutions.  Many industries require scheduling in order to run efficiently and effectively. It can be found in public transportation, hospitals, and educational institutions, among other places. There are many factors to consider in educational settings, particularly at higher education institutions, which makes scheduling a difficult task[1]. Some of the frequent considerations in the case of educa-tional institutions are the availability of lecturers, the number of classes and courses, and budget-ing.

The following are some common limits to consider: only one instructor can teach one class at a time, a room can only hold one class at a time, and students should not have more than one class every session. Hard and soft constraints are frequently used to categorize these limitations
